# 3D Shapes
This section is about how to render 3D objects in a fragment shader, although a lot of the stuff covered here can be used in many different settings. It specifically goes over the raymarching algorithm, the signed distance functions  of some basic shapes, and the basic operations used to combine those shapes.
