My name's Elise, I'm a tool and graphics programmer. I'm currently a student in a game and VFX school. I use this website as a way of keeping notes on the things I learn, so that I can refer to them later. It's also a great pleasure to share things I love.

Right now the website is mainly focused on fragment shaders, because I enjoy them quite a bit, and they can easily be displayed online so they make good content. But I'm also working on a Vulkan based shader editor, so I'll probably be posting about this in the near future.

I also enjoy gameplay programming and have recently discovered the wonderful world of game jams. You can find the games I helped make on my [itch.io page](https://eliselise.itch.io).
