My name's Elise, I'm a Pipeline TD and graphics programmer. I'm currently a student in a game and VFX school. I use this website as a way to keep notes and share everything I'm learning. I try to update it regularly as I learn new things.

Right now the website is mainly focused on fragment shaders, because I enjoy quite a bit. But I'm also working on a Vulkan based shader editor, so I'll probably be posting about this in the near future.
